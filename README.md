# Artificial-Neural-Networks-and-Distribution-Fit-Tests
 It is planned to estimate Normal, Uniform, Exponential, Beta, Weibull, Lognormal, Geometric and Poisson distributions with 95% confidence level using random parameters with Keras library. In addition, data with estimation error will be evaluated with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
